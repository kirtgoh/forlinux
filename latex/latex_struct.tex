\section{Introduction}
This is a sample introduction section.\\
This is a second line in the introduction.\\
This is a third line.

\section{Motivation}
The Motivation behind this tutorial is to share the knowledge for the benefit of
everyone who wants to start using Latex.

\section{Algorithm} In this tutorial I will explain how to write an algorithm in
Latex using the algorithm and algorithmic package in Latex.

Specifically, we will learn the following in this tutorial:

\begin{itemize}
	\item How to write an algorithm in Latex
	\item Use of algorithm and algorithmic package
	\item How to use loops in an algorithm
	\item How to use IF statements in an algorithm
	\item How to add caption to an algorithm 
	\item How to label an algorithm to refer it in the document
\end{itemize}

\begin{algorithm}[H]

\textbf{INPUT:} Set of Base Layer polygon $S_b$ and Set of Overlay Layer polygon
$S_o$\\
\textbf{OUTPUT:} Intersection Graph ($V$,$E$), where $V$ is set of polygons and
$E$ is edges among polygons with intersecting bounding boxes.

	\begin{algorithmic}

	\STATE Parallel Merge Sort set $S_o$ of overlay polygons based on X co-ordinates
	of bounding boxes\footnotemark[1]
	\FORALL{base polygon $B_i$ in set $S_b$ of base polygons}
		\STATE find $S_x \subset S_o$ such that $B_i$ intersects with all elements
		of $S_x$ over $X$ co-ordinate
		\FORALL{overlay polygon $O_j$ in $S_x$}
			\IF {$B_i$ intersects $O_j$ over $Y$ co-ordinate}
			\STATE{Create Link between $O_j$ and $B_i$}
			\ENDIF
		\ENDFOR
	\ENDFOR

	\end{algorithmic}
